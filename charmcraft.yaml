# cryptography cannot be built on the Ubuntu base image (needs ffi),
# so install the binary first, rather than using an alternative base.
# XXX mysqlclient also has this issue (needs default-libmysqlclient-dev
# XXX and pkg-config in particular) - but the workaround doesn't work
# XXX for that case - unclear why this is?
