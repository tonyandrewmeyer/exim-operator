# Improvements to make

 * [ ] Properly set up storage for the queue so it isn't lost if the unit/pod vanishes
 * [ ] Relation to a database to load some values
 * [ ] More interesting configuration options, e.g. list of dnsbl
 * [ ] Other actions, e.g. manipulating the hints dbs
 * [ ] Relation to something for ingress so that a hostname can be used to connect
 * [ ] Observability stack
 * [ ] Add storage for local mail delivery
 * [ ] Relation so that something else (e.g. mutt or roundcube or dovecot) could get the local mail.
 * [ ] Convert the unit tests to use pytest
